### Gm/Id Analog/Mixed-Signal IC Design Tool

This tool is inspired in [Prof. B. Mumman's Gm/Id CAD tool/book](https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design/tree/main/starter_kit), also providing support for interpolation upon look-up. This tool extends the former by being deployed as a Python library, providing an API as well as a CLI that can both be used to perform analog IC design.

The tool can be used with the Gm/Id method in a forward modelling problem:
  - Given: 
    - A DC operating point (e.g., vgs, vds, vsb, ids),
    - A target drain current (ids) or transconductance (gm),
    - A target Gm/Id ratio (encoding inversion region information), and a channel length (lch) (encoding intirnsic gain (Gm/Gds) and maximum operating frequency information (Gm/Cgg))
  - Optain the device width (w) that satisfies the target Gm/Id ratio for the given DC-OP.
If Vgs is not provided, it will also be targetted as an output design parameter to achieve the target Gm/Id ratio.

The tool can also be used in a reverse modelling problem:
  - Given:
    - A DC operating point (vgs, vds, vsb, ids),
    - A device width (w),
    - A channel length (lch),
  - Obtain the electrical characteristics of the device (e.g., gm, gds, cgg, cgs, cgd, etc.)

Note that this tool doesn't take into account the effect of number of fingers right now. This is a feature that will be added in the future.

## 1. Installation

Install as a normal Python package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install novaad
```

## 2. Usage

There are a sequence of steps required to use the tool:
1. Extract the Look-Up Table (LUT) for each NMOS and PMOS device in the technology of interest. 
   1. Example Cadence Ocean scripts are provided in my['cadence-scripts'](https://github.com/das-dias/cadence_workflow/tree/master/cadence-scripts/gmid) directory to extract the LUTs.

2. Make sure the LUTs are provided in ```.csv``` format.
   1. The LUTs should follow the same exact naming convention used in the Cadence Ocean scripts pointed above but without the device type extension (e.g., ```nmos: _n``` or ```pmos: _p```).
   
   2. For both NMOS and PMOS devices, Gate-Source Voltage (Vgs), Drain-Source Voltage (Vds), Source-Bulk (Vsb) and Drain-Source Current (Ids) should be provided in the LUTs with the naming: ```vgs, vds, vsb, ids```.

### *2.1. API*

The CLI is supported by a flexible Python library that can be used from a Python script. The following example shows how to use the library to perform the Gm/Id design:

```python
# Create a Device instance object
device = Device(
        "./test/data/test_nch_lut_renamed.csv",
        device_type="nch",
)

# Perform a customized LUT lookup:

output_cols = ["av", "jd", "ft"]
target = { # all lists must have the same length
    "vgs": [device.lut["vgs"].mean()],
    "vds": [0.9],
    "vsb": [0.0],
    "lch": [device.lut["lch"].min() * 1],
    "gmoverid": [10.0],
}

kwargs = { # interp_method: "pchip" (default), see Pandas.DataFrame.interpolate for more options
    "interp_method": "nearest",
    "interp_mode": "default",
}
row = device.look_up(output_cols,targetreturn_xy=True, **kwargs)

print(row)
""" row ( as Pandas.DataFrame )
Output: 

       jd           lch            ft  gmoverid  vgs  vsb  vds       av
1  8.0358  1.800000e-07  2.770000e+09      10.0  0.9  0.0  0.9  175.469
"""

# Perform a Gm/Id sizing operation for a given device:

sizing_spec = DeviceSizingSpecification(
    vgs=0.5, vds=0.6, vsb=0.0, lch=device.lut["lch"].min(), gmoverid=10.0, gm=1e-3
)
sizing = device.sizing(sizing_spec)
print(sizing.to_df())
""" sizing ( as Pandas.DataFrame )
Output:
            lch       wch
0  1.800000e-07  0.000013
"""
```

This API effectively enables the user to fit the tool into an optimization loop to perform automatic sizing of whole circuits like OTA's, filters, buffers, etc.

### *2.2. CLI*



After extracting the LUT's, create a configuration file using ```.yaml``` format with the following structure:
  

```yaml
# example_config.yaml

nch:
  lut_path: path/to/nmos_lut.csv
  ref_width: 10e-6 # Constant width used to extract the LUT

pch:
  lut_path: path/to/pmos_lut.csv
  ref_width: 10e-6 # Constant width used to extract the LUT

```

This configuration file can be parsed to the CLI to under the ```--config``` flag. Alternatively, you can create a configuration file with the default name ```novaad.cfg.yml``` in the same directory as the CLI is being executed and the tool will automatically load it without the need to specify the ```--config``` flag.

As of ```v.0.1.2``` the tool supports ```.csv``` and ```.h5``` (HDF5 binary) file formats for a more efficient LUT memory storage and readout. The tool will automatically detect the file format and load the LUTs accordingly.


After creating the configuration file and creating the LUTs, you are finally able to use the CLI to perform the Gm/Id design.

* **Input file:**


To use ```novaad```'s design capabilities, you must specify your design targets in an input ```.toml``` file. An example of such file is shown below:

```toml
# example_input.toml
[device]
m0 = { type = "nch", vds = 0.5, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, gmid = 26, gm = 1e-3 }
m1 = { type = "pch", vgs = 0.8, vds = 1.3, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, gmid = 23, gm = 1e-3 } # No output generated for this device; there is no LUT
m2 = { type = "nch" , vgs = 0.8, vds = 0.5, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, gmid = 10, ids = 500e-6 }
m3 = { type = "nch" , vgs = 0.8, vds = 0.5, vsb = 0.0, lch = 1e-6, wch = 12e-6, ids = 100e-6 }

[noise]
m0 = {t_celsius = 36, noise_fmax = 100e6, flicker_corner_freq=30e3}

# the current test lut doesn't support vsb above 0.0
[moscap]
m4 = { type = "nch", vgs = 0.8, vds = 0.5, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, cgg = 1.2e-15 } # vds is ignored and set to minimum in LUT table
m5 = { type = "pch", vgs = 0.8, vds = 1.3, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, cgg = 1.2e-15 } # No output due to no LUT!
m6 = { type = "nch", vgs = 0.8, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, cgg = 1e-14 }
m7 = { type = "nch", vgs = 0.8, vsb = 0.0, lch = 1e-6, cgg = 1e-14 }
m8 = { type = "nch", vgs = 0.8, vsb = 0.0, lch = 1e-6, wch = 12e-6 } # if wch is parsed, cgg is ignored

[switch]
m9 = { type = "nch", vgs = 1.8, vds = 0.5, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, ron = 10 } # vds is ignored and set to minimum in LUT table
m10 = { type = "pch", vgs = 0.8, vds = 1.3, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, ron = 10 } # No output due to no LUT!
m11 = { type = "nch", vgs = 0.8, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, ron = 10 }
m12 = { type = "nch", vgs = 0.8, vsb = 0.0, lch = 180e-9, ron = 10 }
m13 = { type = "nch", vgs = 0.8, vsb = 0.0, lch = 1e-6, ron = 10 }
m14 = { type = "nch", vgs = 0.8, vsb = 0.0, lch = 1e-6, wch = 12e-6 } # if wch is parsed, ron is ignored
```

The input file is separated in four sections:
1. **Device:** This section is used to specify the design targets for the Gm/Id design of transconductor devices. The following parameters are required:
   - ```type```: Device type (```nch``` or ```pch```).
   - ```vgs```: Gate-to-Source Voltage.
   - ```vds```: Drain-to-Source Voltage.
   - ```vsb```: Bulk-to-Source Voltage.
   - ```lch```: Channel Length.
   - ```gmid```: Target Gm/Id ratio.
   - ```gm```: Target transconductance.
   - ```ids```: Target drain current.
   - ```wch```: Channel Width (optional).

2. **Noise:** This section is used to specify the parameters to perform a simple model-based computation of the steady-state thermal and flicker noise for ```device``` instances (**ONLY DEVICE**). The following parameters are required:
   - ```t_celsius```: Temperature in Celsius.
   - ```noise_fmax```: Maximum frequency for noise analysis.
   - ```flicker_corner_freq```: Flicker noise corner frequency.

NOTE: To ignore flicker just set ```flicker_corner_freq = 0.0```.

3. **Moscap:** This section is used to specify the design targets for the Gm/Id design of MOSCAP devices. The following parameters are required:
   - ```type```: Device type (```nch``` or ```pch```).
   - ```vgs```: Gate-to-Source Voltage.
   - ```vds```: Drain-to-Source Voltage.
   - ```vsb```: Source-to-Bulk Voltage.
   - ```lch```: Channel Length.
   - ```cgg```: Target total-gate capacitance.

4. **Switch:** This section is used to specify the design targets for the Gm/Id design of Switch devices. The following parameters are required:
    - ```type```: Device type (```nch``` or ```pch```).
    - ```vgs```: Gate-to-Source Voltage.
    - ```vds```: Drain-to-Source Voltage.
    - ```vsb```: Source-to-Bulk Voltage.
    - ```lch```: Channel Length.
    - ```ron```: Target on-resistance.

NOTE 2: The ```vds``` parameter is ignored for MOSCAP and SWITCH devices and set to the minimum value in the LUT table (ideally, will be set to ```0.0 V``` if such simulation space is included in the LUTs).

By specifing ```device```, ```moscap``` or ```switch``` in the CLI, the tool will perform the Gm/Id design for the corresponding instances in each section of the input file. 

An example:

```bash
# Input:
$ novaad device -i=path/to/example_input.toml --config=path/to/example_config.yaml
```

```bash
# Output:

```


* **GUI**
  
The GUI can be launched in two modes of operation:

1. Giving the ```--gui``` flag and specifying the type of device (```nch``` or ```pch```) to the graphs required to perform the Gm/Id design.
   1. The channel lengths to include in the plot can also be specified using the ```--lch-plot``` flag.

Example:

```bash
# Input:
$ novaad --gui --type=nch --config=path/to/example_config.yaml
```
<div>
<img align=center width=700 src=./docs/figs/gui_mode1.png>
</img>
</div>



2. Giving the ```--gui``` flag and specifying the input file with the design targets. This will open a GUI page containing the result tables for the design targets specified in the input file.

Example:

```bash
# Input:
$ novaad device --gui -i=path/to/example_input.toml --config=path/to/example_config.yaml
```

<div>
<img align=center width=700 src=./docs/figs/device.png>
</img>
</div>
